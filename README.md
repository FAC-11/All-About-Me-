## What? 
An app to help young people at Anna Freud centre to easily transition to adult care. 
The App will allow young people to write their own introdution to their new Adult Mental Health worker, giving them the information that is important to them. 

## Why? 
Currently it can be a very stressful process for young people at Anna Freud to transition to Adult care as they have to repeat stories that can be very distressing for them. 
The current solution to this problem is a paper based form which the young people feel is sub-optimum. An app will allow them to fill in the form at their convenience and in a more engaging way. Helping to make difficult conversations smoother.
